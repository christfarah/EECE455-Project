# EECE455-Project

The code will allow a user to perform arithmetic on polynomials in GF(2m) with (2 <= m <= 8) and

using the following Irreducible Polynomials:

Degree 2: x^2 + x^1 + 1

Degree 3: x^3 + x^2 + 1

Degree 4: x^4 + x^3 + 1

Degree 5: x^5 + x^2 + 1

Degree 6: x^6 + x^1 + 1

Degree 7: x^7 + x^1 + 1

Degree 8: x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1 + 1

The operations to be performed are modulo reduction, finding the inverse, addition, subtraction,

multiplication, and division.

The software should allow inputs and display outputs in either Binary or Hexadecimal.
